This project is based on the (live microphone) Audio-Input-Effects by cwilco. 
Unfortunatly that project is abandoned (it did not had an update for over 6 years) 
and has limited support for modern browsers (Chrome). 

In the process I've also added some new possibilities;
* Record the audio from your live performance.
* Choose a sound file instead of the microphone to add effects to. 

You need Node.js to start this project locally. 
Typ in command prompt (Windows) 'node index.js' and have fun!

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/cwilso/Audio-Input-Effects

The readme on the original github:
# Live Audio Input effects

I whipped this app up to test live audio input, letting the user select a few common tunable effects and see (and hear) the effects.  It's also a good demo of how to build chorus and flanging effects in WebAudio.

Check it out [here](https://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/input/), feel free to fork, submit pull requests, etc.
